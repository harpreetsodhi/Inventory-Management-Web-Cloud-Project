## USER MANAGEMENT PORTAL

#### Cloud Resources Information
The user management portal is built using Sails.js which uses MVC architecture. So, the controller acts as the backend and views are the frontend for our application. This application is containerized and deployed on Amazon AWS as an EC2 instance. The database is hosted on Amazon RDS, which is a managed relational database.

#### Software Used
The user portal is built using sails.js framework where we used HTML, JavaScript and jQuery. For the frontend, we have used Bootstrap for interacive user experience

#### Security mechanisms for communication/storage
Two-phase locking protocol has been used to avoid any false update operation and inconsistency in the orders table maintained by the company. We send the user passwords by encrypting them and store them in database as ciphertext. We have made sure not to store passwords as plaintext anywhere in the code.
